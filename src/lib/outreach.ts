/* =====================================================================
 * OUTREACH INTELLIGENCE — lightweight operational copilot.
 *
 * Distinct from qualification.ts (which coaches DISCOVERY content).
 * This module focuses on OUTREACH EXECUTION:
 *   - what channel to use next
 *   - when to try again
 *   - which contextual "play" to send
 *   - which micro-discovery question to slide into outreach
 *   - momentum signal (operational, not a score)
 *
 * Pure deterministic rules. No AI. No auto-actions. No marketing automation.
 * The user always decides; this module only RECOMMENDS.
